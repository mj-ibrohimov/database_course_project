# Heart Attack Prediction Database Project

A comprehensive database project focused on heart attack prediction analysis, featuring database design, data migration, SQL functions, views, and analytical queries.

## Project Overview

This project implements a relational database system for heart attack prediction analysis. It includes database schema design, data migration scripts, analytical queries, and visualization of results. The project demonstrates practical SQL skills and database management concepts.

## Repository Structure

- **Part 1: Database Foundation**
  - **Part 1.1**: Conceptual model and database design
    - Model description and heart attack prediction schema visualization
  - **Part 1.2**: Schema implementation and data migration
    - SQL scripts for database creation and initial data loading
  - **Part 1.3**: Database functions and views
    - Custom SQL functions and views for data analysis

- **Part 2: Advanced Database Operations**
  - **Part 2.2**: Enhanced data models and migration scripts
  - **Part 2.3**: Analytical queries with visualizations
    - Nine comprehensive SQL queries with result visualizations

## Data Files

- `heart_attack_prediction_dataset.csv`: Primary dataset for heart attack prediction
- `staging_table.csv`: Preprocessed data for database loading

## Key Features

- Complete relational database schema design for medical data
- Data migration scripts for ETL operations
- Custom SQL functions and views for data analysis
- Advanced SQL queries for medical insights
- Query result visualizations

## Technologies Used

- SQL (Primary language for database operations)
- Database Management System (PostgreSQL/MySQL/Oracle)
- Data visualization tools

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Review the database schema in the model description files
3. Execute the database creation scripts (`database_name.sql`)
4. Run the data migration scripts to populate the database
5. Explore the analytical queries in Part 2.3

## Project Outcomes

- Implementation of a comprehensive database for medical data analysis
- Demonstration of SQL skills for complex data operations
